3 different schools want to compare their students mean typing speed between
their classes. They have also recorded the year or grade of each student. They
are not interested in the effect of Year per se, but they want to account for the
effect statistically. For each of the following, answer the question, and show the output from the analyses you used to answer the question.

1) What was the LS mean typing speed for each schoolâ€™s class?

2) Does School have a significant effect on typing speed?

3) Does Year have a significant effect on typing speed?

4) Are the residuals reasonably normal and homoscedastic?

5) Which schools had classes with significantly different mean typing speed from
which others?

6) Does this result correspond to what you would have thought from looking at
the plot of the LS means and standard errors?

7) Is this design balanced or unbalanced?

__With a p-value of 0.91, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and therefore infer that the residuals are homoscedastic. Also we have a much flatter line and an evenly distributed residuals in the Residuals vs Fitted plot(top-left plot)__

__The residuals are reasonably normal and the different school variance data appears to be equal. Looking at the Shapiro test for the residuals, the p-value is 0.6312 and greater than 0.05 so we accept the null hypothesis that the data is normally distributed__
