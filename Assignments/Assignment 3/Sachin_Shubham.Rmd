Task 1

Suppose a coin toss turns up 13 heads out of 20 trials. At .05 significance level,
can one reject the null hypothesis that the coin toss is fair?

Task 2

An outbreak of Salmonella-related illness was attributed to ice cream produced
at a certain factory. Scientists measured the level of Salmonella in 9 randomly
sampled batches of ice cream. The levels (in MPN/g) are : 0.593, 0.142, 0.329,
0.691, 0.231, 0.793, 0.519, 0.392, 0.418.
Is there evidence that the mean level of Salmonella in the ice cream is greater
than 0.3 MPN/g?

prop.test(13, 20, p=0.5, correct=FALSE)

# Our study finds that the  chi-square=1.8,

# reject the null hypothesis that the coin toss is fair. This is strong evidence 
# that the null hypothesis is valid

x = c(0.593, 0.142, 0.329, 0.691, 0.231, 0.793, 0.519, 0.392, 0.418)
t.test(x, alternative="greater", mu=0.3)


# Our study finds that the  t = 2.2051, df = 8, mean is 0.4564444, 
# p=0.02927, 95% CI [0.3245133, Inf]. A greater p(0.02927>0.3), fail to reject

# the null hypothesis. Therefore, we have slight strong evidence that the mean 
# Salmonella level in the ice cream is above 0.3 MPN/g
